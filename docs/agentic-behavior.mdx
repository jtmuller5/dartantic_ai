title: Agentic Behavior - Multi-Step Tool Calling
---

A key feature of an "agent" is its ability to perform multi-step reasoning.
Instead of just calling one tool and stopping, an agent can use the result of
one tool to inform its next action, chaining multiple tool calls together to
solve a complex problem without requiring further user intervention.

Agents will loop, calling tools as many times as needed to fully resolve the
user's prompt. They can use the output from one tool as the input for another,
creating sophisticated chains of execution.

## Example: Multi-Step Tool Execution

Let's see this in action. First, we'll set up some tools and a common prompt.

```dart
// Two simple tools for our agent
final tools = [
  Tool(
    name: 'get_current_time',
    description: 'Get the current date and time.',
    onCall: (_) async => {'time': '2025-06-21T10:00:00Z'},
  ),
  Tool(
    name: 'find_events',
    description: 'Find events for a specific date.',
    inputSchema: {
      'type': 'object',
      'properties': {'date': {'type': 'string'}},
      'required': ['date'],
    }.toSchema(),
    onCall: (_) async => {'events': ['Team Meeting at 11am']},
  ),
];

// A prompt that requires a two-step tool chain
const prompt = 'What events do I have today? Please find the current date first.';

// A helper to print the message history nicely
void printMessages(List<Message> messages) {
  for (var i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
    final m = messages[i];
    print('Message #${i + 1}: role=${m.role}');
    for (final part in m.parts) {
      print('  - $part');
    }
  }
  print('---');
}
```

When you run the agent, it will call the first tool, get the date, and then
immediately use that date to call the second tool.

```dart
final agent = Agent('openai', tools: tools);
final response = await agent.run(prompt);
printMessages(response.messages);
```

The resulting message history shows the full, two-step reasoning chain:

```
Message #1: role=user
  - TextPart(text: "What events do I have today? Please find the current date first.")
Message #2: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: call, id: ..., name: get_current_time, arguments: {})
Message #3: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: result, id: ..., name: get_current_time, result: {time: 2025-06-21T10:00:00Z})
Message #4: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: call, id: ..., name: find_events, arguments: {date: 2025-06-21})
Message #5: role=model
  - ToolPart(kind: result, id: ..., name: find_events, result: {events: [Team Meeting at 11am]})
Message #6: role=model
  - TextPart(text: "You have one event today: a Team Meeting at 11am.")
